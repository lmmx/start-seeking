# start-seeking

Start-seq is a recent technique from Karen Adelman's lab (see: [Scruggs et al. 2015](http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/abstract/S1097-2765(15)00262-2), Mol Cell).

This work analyses MEF cells from the Adelman lab, using notes in a Wiki format to assist the research synthesis process, and make the output of this Masters project potentially accessible/extensible in the future.
